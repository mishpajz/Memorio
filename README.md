# Memorio

Memorio is a journal app for iOS.

The app is completely written in Swift, with UI created in SwiftUI.

## About

Memorio was created by [me](https://github.com/mishpajz) in 2020. It was originally released on the App Store, but has since been deprecated and pulled.

Since then I have decided to make the source code available. Submission of any fork of Memorio to AppStore is prohibited.

## Implementation

Technological challenges:
- Created custom camera, which allows for taking photos or videos and integrates into SwiftUI.
- Created custom player, for simple Instagram Story-like control.
- Enabled Snapchat-like adding text to photos and videos using AVFoundation and CoreGraphics.
- Fetched current weather using OpenWeather API.
- Converted MapView and TextView into SwiftUI component.
- Implemented persistent data storage using CoreData.
- Add SiriIntents for creating new Memories.
- Implemented an in-app purchase that unlocks an unlimited number of Memories per week (otherwise limited) -> Memorio+.
- Made app lock using PIN or FaceID in SwiftUI.
- Created custom SwiftUI calendar.
